# triton-ai-robotflow-intro

## Intro
The goal of this repo is to help people who are new to ai model training to get an idea of the training process and provide a simple way to train, fine tune, and deploy your own ai model from sratch using robotflow.

## Step 1 
Go to the following [website](https://roboflow.com/) and login in. If you don't have one you can create a new one, recommanded to create your account using the school email so others can share projects to you more easily.

## Step 2
Once you are in, create your own work space (public plan). If you want to work with others, you can fill in their emails to invite them (optional). 

## Step 3
Once you inside your new project, please click project -> +project -> Object detection

## Step 4
Once you reach the point to upload data, you are at the very important point of the project. We all know that good quality data matter a lot when we try to get a good AI model, and the more high quaility data we put, the better the train will be. Therefore, please find a lot of images that has a clear gokart (since we are trition ai and we love evgokart) and put them into the upload data.

## Step 5
Nice, you got a bunch of imgs which is a good start. Unfortunately, AI are all babies in the beginning, and they don't know what is gokart. Now as their parent, you need to annoated all the images to tell AI what is what. Please go ahead and annoate your images by select label myself on the right, and draw boxes on the gokart and put label name as gokart. Click next image and label next, and once you finish, please exit thought the small left arrow on the top left. It is indeed a lot of work once you get a lot of images, but later if you are more skilled. You can create your own AI model to help you to do labeling (classifcation model).
